### Hello 👋👋👋👋

Thank you for inviting me for the recruitment process at iwoca, I am so excited about this opportunity😊😊

Here are some of my comments and things I would do differentely if I had a bit more time:

1. **Unit tests** Adding unit tests for components like the button and the API hook is a top priority for me. Unfortunately, time constraints prevented me from including them in my initial submission.
2. **Cypress test** I would add cypress test
3. **Mobile layout** I added a quick fix for the mobile layout, I would improve it a little bit more
4. **File structure** I would change a layout of the files, group them togeter in folders
5. **Typescript** While I incorporated types where necessary, I acknowledge that there is room for improvement in terms of type annotations and overall TypeScript proficiency.
6. **CSS** Making sure the FE is pixel perfect

Things I struggled with:
I had some issues with nvm, setting it up took a bit longer than expected and I had a bit of a delay.

Thank you for dedicating your time to review my application. I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the success of iwoca.
🙏
